Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Course Website Jekyll Template
=======================================================

This repository contains a Jekyll template, patterned entirely off my no-good-very-bad Jekyll Template at [svmiller.com](http://svmiller.com), for organizing a course website. I should note that because I ganked it from my website template, there's a lot of empty tags in the template that make reference to things that don't appear in the main `.yml` file. In other words, they reference things that should be there but, because they're not there, ultimately won't interfere with how the site renders.


# Run the site locally
Install gems: `bundle install`

Run the site: `bundle exec jekyll serve` this will serve the site on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)
